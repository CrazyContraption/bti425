### react-router-intro

This code example is based on the content and code in the `react-app-layout` code example above.  
The React Router package was added. Then:
* `index.js` was updated to wrap the `App` component in `BrowserRouter` 
* `App` was updated to render a `Switch - Route` container 
* The nav menu `a` elements were changed to `Link` elements
